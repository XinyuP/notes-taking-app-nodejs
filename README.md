node teaches JavaScript new things by providing C++ bindings to V8.

Allow JavaScript to do anything that C++ can do(access the file system)

Validator

Nodemon
nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node. 
To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script.

Yargs helps you build interactive command line tools, by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.
It gives you:
commands and (grouped) options (my-program.js serve --port=5000).
a dynamically generated help menu based on your arguments
